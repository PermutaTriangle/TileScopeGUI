# UI

The UI is decoupled from the python server and written in ES6 and SCSS and compiled with Parcel. It requires [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) to build.

## Commands

```bash
npm run install # install dependencies
npm run start   # debug run with watcher (saving updates)
npm run build   # production build into ../tilingsgui/static
npm run test    # run unit tests
npm run lint    # run linters
```
